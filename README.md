# Helados e Idiomas - A Language Learning Webapp Created with AI

Welcome to Helados e Idiomas, a language learning webapp created with the help of AI! This webapp is not designed to help users learn new languages but only as a test of what GPT 3.5 can generate from a conversation with a non-programmer.

## Getting Started

To get started with Helados e Idiomas, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser. From there, you can select a language or country to begin learning new ice cream-related vocabulary.

## About the Project

This project was created using GPT 3.5 to generate prompts and instructions for building the webapp from scratch. The prompts were generated using the OpenAI API via TypingMind.com and were used to guide the development process, from creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to designing the user interface and generating images.

While the webapp is still a work in progress, it demonstrates the potential of using AI to automate web development and make it more accessible to non-programmers. We hope that this project inspires others to explore the possibilities of using AI in web development and to create their own innovative webapps.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in improving Helados e Idiomas! Whether you have ideas for new features, suggestions for improving the user interface, or just want to help with writing blog content about it, we would love to hear from you. To contribute, simply create a pull request with your changes and we'll review them as soon as possible.

## License

This project has no license at all.

## Acknowledgments

We have paid OpenAI for providing the API used to generate prompts and instructions for building the webapp. Finally, we would like to thank our users for their feedback and support as we continue to develop and improve this webapp.
